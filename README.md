# julian-website
This will become my personal homepage including: portfolio for copywriter and screenwriter, a blog for my novels and short stories as am author. Furthermore there will be a small section for photography and a shop for the "Mr Hat" franchise that I hopefully start with my brother. And last but not least a short info page about my film podcast plus a links to all the podcast providers. Good luck to myself :-)
